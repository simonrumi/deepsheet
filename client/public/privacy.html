   <body>
      We are not sharing the content of your sheets with anyone.<br>
		When you use a 3rd party like Facebook or Google to login, we are using an ID from those systems (a long string of numbers and letters that means nothing to a human), so that we can identify which sheets are yours. If we didn't do that, you wouldn't be able to save your work and access it later.<br>
		We are not storing any other data, not even your email address.
